# FA20HackMIT-Noom

Welcome to Noom! 

Want to watch lectures with other students but donâ€™t have friends in your class? Looking for study buddies to hold each other accountable? Collaborative remote learning has never been easier!

Once you enter the webpage, all you have to do is select the lecture video, enter your name, and sign up for a time slot. Now all there is to do is vibe in the Noom room while others who want to watch at the same time filter in! Once the time slot begins, the video will start and the chatbox will be made available. You can chat privately or with the whole group if questions arise. You can see how many participants are in the room at any time, and exit back to the main room at any time. 

So far, the chat box functionality and the video streaming have yet to be implemented. Some features we'd also like to add include the option to host a lecture if it is not shown on the main page (which will create a new card so other users can access it), a search feature with filtering options (ex. by subject, school, professor), and the ability to see all the times other users have set to host Noom rooms.
